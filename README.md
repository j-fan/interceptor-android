# interceptor
This is an interactive artwork created Processing and Android Processing.
This artwork imitates a conventional mobile chat client but with the addition of a interceptor(laptop) that collects and modifies messages on route to the recipient. The interceptor also logs and displays the latest conversations, intended to be shown on a large screen in the exhibition space. It aims to demostrate in a simple way, both the playful and serious effects of man-in-the-middle attacks.
